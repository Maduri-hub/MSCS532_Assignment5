# MSCS532_Assignment5
In this assignment, the key findings are:
•	For standard quicksort, worst case time complexity is O(n^2). 
•	For randomized quicksort, it is O(nlogn) in all cases.
•	For Random Input, both deterministic and randomized Quicksort perform similarly. For Sorted and Reverse-Sorted Input, deterministic Quicksort slows down significantly. Randomized Quicksort remains efficient.


How to run?

1.	To run quicksort, run `quicksort.py`
2.	To run randomized quicksort, run ` randomised.py`
3.	To run comparison between deterministic and randomized quicksorts, run `compare.py`
